# 🧬 DNA Consent & Access Smart Contract

A privacy-first smart contract system that empowers individuals to control access to their DNA data for research, healthcare, and genomic studies.

--- 
 
## 📌 What is This? 

This smart contract enables a **decentralized and transparent consent system** for DNA or genomic data access.

### Key Features: 

- 👤 **User-controlled consent**: Only the data owner can grant or revoke access to their DNA information.
- 🧪 **Researchers request access**: Researchers submit access requests, but can't access data unless explicitly approved.
- 🔒 **Immutable access logs**: All events (requests, approvals, revocations) are logged on-chain.
- 📚 **Transparent collaboration**: Ideal for ethical genomic research, ancestry tools, and biotech platforms.

## 🧠 Why This Matters

### 🔐 1. **Protects Genetic Privacy**

DNA data is highly sensitive and uniquely identifiable. Centralized platforms are vulnerable to misuse or breaches. This contract ensures only explicitly permitted researchers can access DNA-related data.

### 🧬 2. **User-Centric Control**

Current DNA platforms (like 23andMe or AncestryDNA) own the permissions. This contract puts that power back in the hands of users.

### 🌐 3. **Supports Ethical Research**

By providing a verifiable, trustless permission layer, this contract encourages responsible data access by biotech firms, universities, and decentralized science (DeSci) DAOs.
